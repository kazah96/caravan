### What's that?
Caravan card game, like seen in Fallout New Vegas.

### Is it same as original
Almost. Although some changes have been made: Starting deck is always a standard 52 card deck for both players.

For me, victory conditions in FNV were not clear enough (or just buggy), so here the winner is the one who collected 3 caravans first.

### How to play:
1. Come to https://caravanonline.site/

2. Create a new room and send the link to a friend.

### What i want to implement next:
1. AI player
2. Animations for cards, because now it sometimes is not clear what opponent have done their last move

### Troubleshooting
If you saw a bug, you are welcome to raise an issue!
